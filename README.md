# Costs Calculator

## Description

Add a date (required) then, optionally, add an amount spent for that day. I'd recommend that you do this every day - even on the days you don't spend anything - in order to get an accurate average.

If you haven't spent anything, just add the date, then submit (with our without an accompanying note).

- If you try to submit a blank field in either of the number fields, you get an alert popup.
- You cannot submit the form without specifying a date.

Additionally, you can:

- delete a row,
- drag and drop a row.

This is so that:

- if you make a mistake, you can delete and start again, and
- if you forget a day, you can make a new entry, then drag it to the correct position.
